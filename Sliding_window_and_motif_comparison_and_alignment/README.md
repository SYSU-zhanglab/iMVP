By using sliding window, we can extend iMVP to search motif along the sequences, just like traditional software. Any overrepresented motif will be found. However, by using sliding window, the sensitivity of iMVP reduces. We suggest using iMVP when the "phase-mismatch" is limited (e.g., CLIP-seq).

Make sure that MEME has been installed for Tomtom.
